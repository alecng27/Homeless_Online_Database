# About {-}

Database Source Code - https://github.com/alecng27/Homeless_Online_Database

This project is the end result from the internship with Hope Street Coalition.
The goal is to create a database to help the public and decision makers understand HUD homelessness data- particularly the trends of homelessness counts and how they compare with housing inventory trends. The database provides an ability to compare local data with state data and generate graphic representations of the data.
