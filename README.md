  <p>
    This project is the end-product from an internship with Hope Street Coalition. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Hope Street Coalition seeks to advocate for the vulnerable living and dying on the streets. The goal is to create a database using the raw data retrieved from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to help the public and decision makers understand the severity of homeless situation in the U.S.
  </p>

  <p>
    The database provides the ability to compare local data with state data and generate graphic representations of the data.
